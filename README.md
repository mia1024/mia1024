## GUI Applications 
- [Universal Coursework Hub](https://github.com/mia1024/universal-coursework-hub) (2021 - current)
  - A chrome extension aiming to improve the general efficiency of college students. Work in progress.
- [Restructured Notes](https://github.com/mia1024/restructured-notes) (2020)
  - An Electron app that aims to improve students' note-taking experiences and efficiency for STEM classes. I have since realized that it is a much larger project than I had thought and I probably can't finish it all by myself while I'm a full time student. It is currently suspended, but will be resumed in the future if the opportunity arises. 

## Bots
- [Discord Mosaic Bot](https://github.com/mia1024/discord-mosaic-bot) (2020 - current)
  - A Discord chatbot written in Python that sends out solid-color emojis as pixels for pixel arts. Work in progress.
